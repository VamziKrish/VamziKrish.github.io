## Finding the Most Popular Movies in every meainstream Genre

### The Goal

Movies have been a big part of my life. Coming from a family who is heavily involved in the entertainment buinsess back home in India , I was exposed to alot of sets used for movies and the busstling movie envronment.However my family would always debate about which movie was better and the best movies in genres.Instead of endless speech and debate by my family and meaningless stats on the internet,I have decided I want to use what I have learnt in this course to find out the most popular movie in each genre and put the debate to rest in my household.

### The Plan

-1.Identifying the mainstream relavant and non-overlapping genres
-2.The mainstream movies in each of these genres (the ones which are clear favorites)
-3.Preprocess and filter the data
-4.Build working code
-5.Run the code on the cluster.Obtain the results and declare the winner in each category

### The Genres

When i first started looking at the number of genres i was astonished as there so many.However most of them could be grouped together as they were overlapping.Ex: Horror , Paranomic Thriller
Funfact: Did you know the Dutch popular movie Jackie(2012) is a "Costume Drama Comedy" film

So in the end i decided to take up 6 main stream genres and 21 sub genres.I limited each sub-genre to 2-3 films at max. PS:My uncle who works in BD analytics suggested to do so.

## The final table 

This table consists of all the genres,subgenres and movies im working with.
